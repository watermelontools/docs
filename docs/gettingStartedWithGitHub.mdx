# Getting started with Watermelon's GitHub application

## Introduction
To start using Watermelon's GitHub application, you need to follow these steps:
- Go to the [Watermelon GitHub marketplace listing](https://github.com/marketplace/watermelon-context) and click "Install it for free"
- Go to the [Watermelon dashboard](https://app.watermelontools.com/) to authorize the app on your GitHub organization or user account
- Once GitHub is authorize, Watermelon will start indexing information on your organization's Pull Requests. Additionally you can go to the dashboard to authorize other services (such as Slack, Notion, or Jira) to contextualize your Pull Requests.

## Settings
Watermelon shows the 3 most relevant search results for each service on each Pull Request. If you wish to customize the number of search results each service shows, go to the [settings menu](https://app.watermelontools.com/settings) on the dashboard.
