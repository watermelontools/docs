# Watermelon Overview

## Introduction
Watermelon's mission is to help software engineering teams deliver code that meets the business requirements faster. 

For software engineering teams that spend a lot of time discussing which variation of their code is the one that generates the most value for the user, Watermelon provides a set of [open-source plug-ins](https://github.com/watermelontools) to enrich the code review process with business logic contextualization.

To do this we're building an **open-source passive documentation search engine** that serves both our IDE extensions (we currently support VS Code and IntelliJ) as well as our GitHub application (we will support more version control systems in the near future).

## What is passive documentation?
According to Silona Bonewald (former Director of InnerSource Commons), *“Passive documentation is the record of the documentation we create every day while communicating openly.”* For example, as you talk about code in systems such as GitHub Pull Requests, Slack message threads, Linear tickets or Confluence pages, you’re creating passive documentation.

Historically, open-source software has this very well figured out. Hundreds of people distributed across the globe can collaborate on a project because all the context and rationale for decisions are documented passively through conversations on GitHub, mailing lists, IRC, etc. We want to bring those benefits to private software teams. As a codebase and the customer base of a product grows its codebase grows, its business requirements grow and its need for the findability of passive documentation grows as well.

## Watermelon in your workflow
Watermelon is available both as an IDE plugin and as a GitHub app. To get started with one of our IDE extensions, you don't need to authenticate to additional services (although it's highly encouraged). To work on your CI/CD, you need to authorize Watermelon on your GitHub organization (additional services are optional but highly encouraged).
