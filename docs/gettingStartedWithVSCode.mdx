# Getting started with Watermelon's VS Code extension

## Introduction
To get started with Watermelon's VS Code extension, you can install it directly from the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WatermelonTools.watermelon-tools). With this quick start setup, Watermelon will index info from your local git system. 

Optionally, you can go to the Watermelon dashboard to authorize and let your IDE index information from various information sources such as Slack, Notion and Linear.
