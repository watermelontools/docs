# Watermelon API

We try to keep the API as simple as possible, and we currently offer only 3 endpoints. We will return the full context taking into consideration the user's connected services and their settings.

## Actions

To be used to comment from GitHub, not currently open.
This endpoint will write a comment to the PR.

### Context

Will return the whole context as a Markdown Comment in the PR.

## Extension

To be used from the IDEs.

### Hover

Will return a list of single element hits for the connected services. Does _not_ return an AI summary.

### Context

Recieves:

```js
{
    email: string,
    gitSystem: "github"| "gitlab"| "bitbucket",
    repo: string,
    owner: string,
    commitList: string[]
}
```

Returns an array of services that contain the same information.

```js
{
    [serviceName]: {
    title: string;
    body?: string;
    link?: string;
    number?: number | string;
    image?: string;
    }[]
}
```
