# About Watermelon

Welcome!
[Watermelon Tools](https://watermelontools.com) is a company with a mission to make developing as a team easier. We started in February 2022 with a VSCode extension and have built on it.

Our philosophy is to be Open Core, which means our most notable product, [our VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WatermelonTools.watermelon-tools) is [Open Source](https://github.com/watermelontools/wm-extension). 
These are our Open Docs.

## How to use

You will first have to register in [our app](https://app.watermelontools.com). This will create a token and sessions. You will also have to login on [VSCode](https://app.watermelontools.com/vscode), [VSCode Insiders](https://app.watermelontools.com/vscode-insiders) or [VSCodium](https://app.watermelontools.com/vscodium).

## Paid features

We do have some paid features, including our Jira and Slack integrations and unlimited usage for version control systems.
