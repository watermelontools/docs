# Getting started with Watermelon's IntelliJ Plugin

## Introduction
To get started with Watermelon's IntelliJ plugin, you can install it directly from the [JetBrains marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22251-watermelon-intellij-template). With this quick start setup, Watermelon will index info from your local git system. 

Optionally, you can go to the Watermelon dashboard to authorize and let your IDE index information from various information sources such as Slack, Notion and Linear.
